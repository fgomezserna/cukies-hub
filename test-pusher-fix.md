# Pusher Fix Test v1

## What was fixed:
1. **Issue**: The dapp was connecting to Pusher without sending the `session_token`, causing authentication failures with "missing" token.

2. **Solution**: Modified `usePusherGameConnection` to:
   - Create a custom Pusher client instance with custom authorizer
   - Store session token in localStorage when session starts 
   - Retrieve session token from localStorage during Pusher auth
   - Clean up localStorage when session ends

3. **Changes Made**:
   - `dapp/src/hooks/use-pusher-game-connection.ts`: Added custom authorizer with localStorage session token retrieval
   - `dapp/src/app/games/sybil-slayer/page.tsx`: Added localStorage storage/cleanup for session tokens

## Test Instructions:
1. Open http://localhost:3011/games/sybil-slayer
2. Check browser console for authentication logs
3. Look for successful "✅ [PUSHER AUTH] Session access granted" messages
4. Verify no more "❌ [PUSHER AUTH] No authentication method available" errors

## Expected Results:
- Dapp should successfully authenticate with Pusher using session token
- No "missing" session_token errors in logs  
- Both dapp and game should connect to the same Pusher channel
- Real-time communication should work between dapp and game
